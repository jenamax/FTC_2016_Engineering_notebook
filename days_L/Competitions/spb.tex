\subsubsection{PML30 Scrimage (23.01.16)}
The team members who were in this competition:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evgeniy Maksimychev: programmer, operator 
	
	\item Timur Babadzhanov: programmer
	
	\item Victoria Loseva: operator
\end{enumerate}
There were 3 teams here (including our). So it was decided play matches 2x1. Nobody couldn't score debris to boxes. But we have advatage that we have good autonomous period (other teams hadn't it).\newline
We won all qualifying matches and decided play final matches alone. During final matches autonomous period didn't work in both rounds because debris get under the robot's wheels and it couldn't move normaly. But we still won because in first round our opponent got 2 penalties due to control more than 5 debris. In the second round our opponent got 1 pelalty but even if they didn't get it we still were able win. Thats because we pull out debris from their floor goal before end game.\newline
