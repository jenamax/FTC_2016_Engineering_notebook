\paragraph{19 of December}
Today there were training matches
\begin{itemize}
	\item It was finished wiring for servos. Servos were set up.
	
	\item It was tested the gripper with transmission for speed 1:2. It was found that it can't grip elements because brush is too rigidly and motor can't turn. So it was decided to make transmission 1:1.
	
	\item Also we debuged programme for autonomous period for scoring climbers.
	
	\item During the trainings of teleop period it was found that robot still can't climb to ramp. Robot can reach first churro but after that it slip down. We didn't understand why it happened. To solve this problem we tryed to remove caterpillar from back wheels. We thought that it rise them and distane that robot must rise for climbing to first churro reduse. But it was not enough. So during the matches we scored only to low box.
	
	\item Also we communicated with other teams. There were 3 teams (except our). Nobody had programme for autonomous period and nobody was able to score debris to boxes.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{20 of December}
Today there were qualifying and final matches.\newline
We won 3 from 4 qualifying matches. One match we lost because The chain on the wheels base came off. So we became 3 by the results of qualifying matches and played final match and won it.\newline
Summary:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item During matches we scored about 10 debris for match (worse than in "Robofest-South").
	
	\item There was a problem that chain on wheel base came off. Maybe that's due to bias of it. Other mechanisms worked stable.
	
	\item In addition we saw competitions or RC cars and payed attention on their wheels. They are very soft. Maybe if we'll install similar wheels on our robot it help us climb to mountain. They will bend when robot balk to churro and so robot don't get stuck as with rigidly wheels.  
\end{enumerate}
