\subsubsection{Lift}
\begin{itemize}
\item The lift consists of two beams. One beam is stationar and it is fixed vertically on the back part of the robot. The second beam turns by DC motor that mounted at the top of stationar beam. The length of beams must allow to score debris to the high goal from the middle zone and to middle goal from low zone.

\item For estimating optimal length of beams it was made drawing in GeoGebra. It was found that minimal length of moving beam is 41cm.

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\item Later it was found that reach middle zone of mountain is not easy. So it was decided to remake a moving beam so that it can increase it's length. It was estimated (from the drawing in GeoGebra) that minimal length of moving beam for scoring to high box is 70 cm.

%\end{figure}

\item It was decided use two furniture slats for increasing length of turning beam. They fixed to two Tetrix beams as showed in the picture. Also it was looked variant with construction profile that fixed on the side of beams. It fixed rigidly to one beam and second beam slide on it. But in this case we need profile 50cm in length and there is no enough space for it. In addition we tought about lift made of retracktable slats. But if slates fixed to one side from the bucket slats will bend. If slats fixed from both sides from the bucket it will take up much space.

		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/13}}
		\caption{Mount for slats}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure} 
\item For extracting slats it was decided use the next mechanism. The servo fixed on the first Tetrix profile (which doesn't extract). It turn the beam that pivotally connected with other beam that connected with slat (pivotally too). So when servo turn the point of connection the second beam with slat start move horizontally and slat extraxts.

		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/15}}
		\caption{Schematic drawing of the mechanism for extracting slat}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\item It was calculated moment of force of servo that exract lift. We calculated it as multiplication of weight of extracting part (bucket, debris, half of slats, Tetrix beam and servos that turn bucket) and length of beam that mounted to servo. We got the result 14.25 kg*cm (weight of construction 950g length of beam 15cm). So it was decided use servo with moment 18.5 kg*cm. But this calculations are wrong because we didn't take in account that beam that fixed on the servo push the second beam at the something angle (that < 90 degrees). So part of force is lost.

\item It was decided to make mechanism for extracting lift with blocks and rope that mounted on the reel that rotate by servo of continuous rotation. It was decided to install two spools and two ropes so that one rope rise the lift and second - lower it. This mechanism provide holding of the lift position.

\subsubsection{Bucket} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The bucket's size allow to fit 3 cubes and 2 balls. So we can collect 5 cubes (because size of cube is smaller than size of ball) or 3-4 balls. It is enough for us because we want to concentrate on collecting cubes. 
\item For estimating optimal size and form it was made drawing in GeoGebra. During designing model of the bucket for all sizes were made dimention tolerances 2cm.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[h]{\linewidth}
		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/01}}
		\caption{Drawing of the bucket}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure} 
\item But after that it was decided to change size of the bucket. The width entrance hole and width of the scoring box should be the same (The width of the box for debris - 14.5cm. So it was decided to make the bucket's width 13.5 - 14cm). It ensure maximal accuracy of scoring debris. It was decided to make bucket that can fit 5 cubes or 3 balls.

		{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/06}}
		\caption{Model of the bucket}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\item For building bucket it was decided use plastic PET 0.5mm. It is easy to cut it, it light, cheap and clear that allow us to see how much elements are incide the bucket.
\item The bucket mounts to beam that turns by the servo which fixed on the lift. It need because else we have to make detail that fix bucket to the elevator on the defined angle. It require high accuracy. So it will be difficult to make this detail. In addition the mount with servo extend operational window of the lift. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[h]{\linewidth}
		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/11}}
		\caption{Model of the mount for bucket}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\item Later the mount of bucket to servo was changed. It was decided to make it without gear because gears can slip and they have a big backlash.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[h]{\linewidth}
		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/22}}
		\caption{Changed mount for bucket}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure} 

\item The bucket equped by the cover that turn by the servo and close entrance hole of the bucket. It prevent to falling debris out it during turning of the moving beam of lift. Also it can to prevent balls get into the bucket when we collect only cubes. When it closed not fully (so that distance between bottom edge of cover and floor is about 6cm) the cube can get into the bucket but the ball is not. When we open cover the balls can get to the bucket.
\item The cover fix on 14cm beam that turn by the servo. It was decided use so long beam as the most optimal variant when cover move vertically because otherwise it can to prevent rotating gripper for debris. When it turn around the circle with big radius trajectory of cover's moving is close to vertical.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{minipage}[h]{\linewidth}
		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/07}}
		\caption{The bucket with cover}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\item Later it was found that when cover close so that balls can't get to bucket cubes get to bucket very hard. But it doesn't problem because it very easy to collect only cubes without a special system. We can just don't come to balls too close without problems.

\item During tests it was found that it will be difficult turn to box by the robot. So it was decided make mechanism that turn it to side. 

\item The mechanism for turning bucket to side is a beam that turn along the top plane of moving beam of the lift. The servo that turn it is fixed in the middle of moving beam of the lift. It connected with the chain gear (through the transmission in order to prevent failure of servo due to chain tension). The second chain gear is in the bottom of moving beam of the lift and it turn beam with bucket. It was decided make this system because servo take up much space and if it fixed near the bucket it will prevent it's turning.

		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/12}}
		\caption{Mechanism for turning bucket to side}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\item Later it was decided make this mechanism less complex. At the end of turning beam of the lift was fixed servo (at the center of it) and beam where fixed bucket connected with the servo without gear

		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/16}}
		\caption{Optimized mechnism for turning bucket to side}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\item During tests it was found that we still can't reach the box to side. So it was decided to remake cover. The servo that turn cover was moved as close as possible to it. So when cover open cubes slide on it and fall to box. 

\item Also they were calculated moments of force that acts to servos. From this calculations they were choosed servo for turning bucket and cover. During the calculation were taken into account mass of construction elements and safety coefficient 1.5 For turning bucket (up and down and to side) it was decided use servo MG996R (torque 11kg*cm) for cover - HS-485HB(torque 5.9 kg*cm).

		\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{days_L/Lift+bucket/images/09}}
		\caption{The table of moments for servos}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\item In addition it was calculated moment of force that acts to DC motor that turn lift. So it was decided to install transmission with gear ratio 8:1.
