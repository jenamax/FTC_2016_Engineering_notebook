  \textit{\textbf{Detailed explaination:}}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item We made a drawing in GeoGebra where were estimated angles of inclination of the lift for scoring elements and pulling.
  	
  	\item We looked the variant with DC motor and transmission for power but it take up much space.
  	
  	\item We decided use the servo of continuous rotation with worm gear. The worm gear esure power and allow to keep position.
  	

  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{\textbf{Additional comments:}} \newline
  Tasks for the next meeting:
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item To make a schematic model of the robot
  	
  	\item To devide the robot into modules.
  	
  	\item To make a technical task for each module and start parallel elaborating models of each module.
  \end{enumerate}
