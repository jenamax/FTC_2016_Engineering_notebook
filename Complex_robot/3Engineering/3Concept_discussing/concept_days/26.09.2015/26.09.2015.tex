  \textit{\textbf{Detailed explaination:}}
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item We decided to refuse from suspension on wheel base because it is too complex and reduse reliability of the robot.
  	
  	\item We decided to use lift that consists of retracktable construction profiles. This system is more reliable.
  	
  	\item We decided to overturn the bucket back and turn the robot because when we overturn it to the side we need ride to the ramp very accurate. In addition when we overurn it to the side we need very long bucket. 
  	
  	\item We decided to score climbers in tele op with help of the servo which turn the beam (one servo on each side of the robot). This mechanism is more compact.
  	
  	\item Also we thought that for scoring elements and pulling we need different angle of inclination of the lift. So we need the mechanism that turn it.
  	
  \end{enumerate}

  \textit{\textbf{Additional comments:}} What to do the next meeting.
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item To think of the mechanism that turn the lift.
