\section{Thanks and prospects} 
    We enjoyed working on a custom and non-standard project, which, besides its technical aspect, included working with new people who shared our values of friendship and mutual understanding. 
    
    Our team is planning to continue doing robotics and setting new goals for ourselves in order to improve. This is our first year taking part in FTC and we will participate next year as well. If we don't realize ourselves this year, we'll look at all our mistakes, correct them, and preform a lot better next year.
   
    In any case, we are ready to learn new things, improve ourselves and expand our skills. 
    
    None of us know for sure what we want to do in the future, but we are certain that our experience will be very valuable to us. 
    
    Our thanks go to the company FIRST for organizing this competition, which we are very happy to be participating in. We appreciate this wonderful opportunity to test ourselves and learn something new and wish them success and growth in their future endeavors.
    
    Also we thank our sponsors: company PTC and it's Russian representative "Irisoft" and charitable foundation "Finist" for their support. Also we thank Physics-Mathematics Lyceum 30 and it's director Alexey Tretyakov for providing comfortable conditions for preparation to competition.
