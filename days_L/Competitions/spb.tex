\subsubsection{PML30 Scrimage (23.01.16)}
The team members who were in this competition:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Evgeniy Maksimychev: programmer, operator 
	
	\item Timur Babadzhanov: programmer
	
	\item Victoria Loseva: operator
\end{enumerate}
There were 3 teams here (including ours). So it was decided play matches 2x1. Nobody couldn't score debris to boxes. But we had the advatage that we had a good autonomous period (other teams didn't).\newline
We won all qualifying matches and decided play final matches alone. During final matches autonomous period didn't work in both rounds because debris get under the robot's wheels and it couldn't move normaly. But we still won because in first round our opponent got 2 penalties due to controlling more than 5 debris elements. In the second round our opponent got 1 pelalty, but even if they hadn't gotten it, we still would have won. That's because we pulled out debris from their floor goal before end game.\newline
