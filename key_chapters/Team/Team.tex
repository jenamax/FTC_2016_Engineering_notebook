\section{Team PML 30 X} 
	Team PML 30 X was assembled in September 2014 in the Russian city of St. Petersburg. Tasks and roles were distributed among the participants, and we established rules of safety. The team placed spreading principles of gracious professionalism to others on the first place of importance. All decisions were made collectively inside the team, with discussions to find the most optimal solutions. 
	During the last year we took part in many events. We pursued and distributed the principles of gracious professionalism, and encouraged people to participate in the competition. By talking to the press, we hoped to attract more attention to our team and to the competition in general - as well as attracting sponsors. The latter was important because of the need for funds - purchasing materials and equipment costs a lot.
	Last season our team took part in the three qualifying competitions, in the regional finals, in European championship and in the World championship. In all of them we made new contacts, shared our experiences and provided mutual assistance to other teams. In the first qualifying rounds in Sochi we met Stuy Fission 310 from the USA, and we maintain contact with them to this day. On the regional finals, we met with a team from Romania, Auto Vortex, and we keep in touch with them through Facebook. Also, there is an active group chat with a large number of Russian teams. You can find the team page in Facebook at the address https://www.facebook.com/ftcpml30phi.
	To increase the efficiency of our team work we use the version control system GitHub, which allows the entire team to work simultaneously on a single projects without losing files, and provides an easy way to resolve roblems. And for writing technical books we been used professional typesetting system LaTeX.
